# Sci-calcy-v1
HI! don't have much to say because it is self-explanatory~~

    Features:
    Simple calulation with 2 Numbers (add,subtract,multiply,divide,find remainder)
    Finding Roots of Equations (x^1 , x^2 and x^3) and Nature of Roots
    Trigonometric Functions (Sine Cosine Tan) & Inverse Trigonometric Functions
    Matric Operations (adding,subtracting,multiplying,transposing)

    Core Idea: 
  
  To keep adding new features in the form of functions with a simple switch-case approach for option-choosing, printing different ASCII arts if the result is a certain value ;) and eventually having it all on a G.U.I with pages for 
    Menu, 
    Options, 
    Each Operation, 
    Result, 
    and finally cool Donut animations.
